‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm

A running MongoDB instance (either local or on a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas).

Installation & Setup
Navigate to the Directory:

cd sihbackend/NodejsBackend

Install Dependencies:

npm install

Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root of the NodejsBackend directory. This is crucial for security and configuration.

# Your MongoDB connection string
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# A strong, secret key for signing JWT tokens
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key

# The port for the server to run on
PORT=4000

Running the Server
Once the dependencies are installed and the environment variables are configured, you can start the server.

npm start

The server will connect to your MongoDB database and start listening for requests, typically on http://localhost:4000. You should see a confirmation message in your terminal.
